                little and nice puppy with an extremely wide
                and open heart. He or she will love you more than
                anybody else in the world, you will see!</p>

        <div class="about_title">About the shelter <br> “Cozy House”</div>
        <p>Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats
            on our hands and statistics show that only 20%
            of them will find a family. The others will continue
            to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky
            chance to become dearly loved.</p>
        <p>We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that
            they do not get sick, feel comfortable (including
            psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87
            volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels.
            About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter
            staff. Taking care of the animals, they become
            attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave
            them alone.</p>
